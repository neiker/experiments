# Experiments on this project

## Sorted List (WIP)
Drag&drop items on a list while you keep the posibility of scroll over the elements.

## Draggable Stickies (WIP)
Sticky notes you can drag&drop and also resize. All happening on the UI thread.

## Twitter Header
Pseudo-sticky header. It disappears when you scroll down and appears again as soon as you scroll up. Works on react-navigation so we use react context to comunciation between screen and navigation creator component.

## Animated Wave
Just an animated SVG.
